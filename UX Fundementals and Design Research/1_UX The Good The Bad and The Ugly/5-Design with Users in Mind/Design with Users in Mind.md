Designers work very hard to display new and cool features to users. Unfortunately, this doesn't mean users will care about either the effort that went into the features or the features themselves.

Because of the large amount of effort designers put into their design, they forget that the product takes up a small part of the user's attention.

It's important that designers take into account that the user won't spending that much time in the application and because of this, not try to force users to stay longer than they need to.

It's important to ask:

* Who are our users?
* What do they need?


In other words, designers need to let go of their ego and make the user the center of their thinking. This is called **user-centered-design**.

The design processes should be made in way where the ygather valid data on whow the users really are and what they actually need, rather than what the designer thinks they need.

A good textbook about this can be found [here](https://www.nngroup.com/books/the-design-of-everyday-things/)

# Quick Design Sketch

As mentioned previously, the two main questions that should be asked while sketching is as follows:

1. Who are our users?
2. What do they need?

Two designers would solve the same design problem differently depending on what their answers are for these two questions.


## Sketch Exercise

Draw a two simple screens that allows consumers to:

* Choose food
* Pay


![](my%20sketches.png)

Answering the two questions for these sketches:

1. Who are the users?

The design is for users who want to order a food based on how the food looks and wants to pay right away, without thinking about payment details.

2. What do they need?

They would just need to find the food that looks good to them and pay right away.
