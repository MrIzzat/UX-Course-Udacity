Good UX is:

1. Usable: users should be able to learn how to use the product easily
2. Aesthetically pleasing: good design should be easy to look at. A user will feel a design is more usable just because it's more aesthetically pleasing, this phenomenon is called **aesthetic-usability effect** ([more info](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/aesthetic-usability-effect/)).
3. Delightful to the user: Good design is a nice surprise to the user. They don't always expect it but they're happy to see it.

An example of good UX is craigslist, because it's easy for a user to get exactly what they want without needing more than one click.
