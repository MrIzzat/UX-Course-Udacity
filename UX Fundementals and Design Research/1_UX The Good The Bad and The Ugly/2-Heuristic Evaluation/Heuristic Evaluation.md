The benefit of heuristic evaluation is that it can be done inhouse.

It's a cheap and quick way to evaluate the design of the product.

A heuristic evaluation can be done by:

1. Finding 3-5 experts that understand usability principles and the current product.
2. Creating heurisitcs as a team. The heuristics (nielsen) can be modified to work with the product.
3. Tasks should be identified, the critical user journeys that need to be evaluated should be found.

An example of a journey in a ecommerce website is *how to purchase an item*

4. Individual evaluation. Each expert should evaluate the design independantly. Issues with the design should be searched for. If found, the severity of the issue should be noted.

5. The results should be aggregated from the entire team, i.e. pooled.
