See usable security notes 11 for more information about heuristics.

A **heuristic** is a general rule or process that is used to help solve a problem quickly. Heuristics don't always generate the most optimal solution, but the solutions they do generate are very practical and instant.

A product's usability evaluated against the heuristics to determine if it's usable.

Usually, lots of research is needed before starting with the UX of a project. This requires lots of time and money. Heuristics are used as an alternative to research as they are quicker and come at no cost.

There are many different kinds of heuristics, a famous set are the 10 heuristics by Jakob Nielsen.

# Nielsen Heuristics

1. **Visibility of system status**: There should always be feed back to user actions. The user should be kept informed one way or another about what's going on in the system. 

For example, if the system is retrieving data that's going to take time to display, the user should be informed about the delay in a clear and concise way. It's even better if the user can be distracted to forget that they're waiting.

2. **Match between system and the real world**: The language used by the system should be something familiar to the user. Internal jargon or technical keywords should be avoided as not all users may intuitively understand them. It's better to use real world convetions. 

For example, if a user enters a website and they see a "cart", they'll understand quickly that the car represents a shopping cart. 

Another example, when snapchat uses the term "snap", it's unclear what they're refering to snapping a picture normally or if it's some special way of going about it.

3. **User control and freedom**: Users should be able to have some control over process.

For example, users should be able to cancel, undo or redo any actions they have done.

4. **Consistency and standards**: Products should follow standards and use consistent wording, concepts, interactions etc. throught the entire product. This is so users don't have to learn new methods for achieving the same goal.

For example, the standard for implementing a traffic light would be using the red for stop, yellow for caution and green for go. It would be inconsistent for a city to implement a traffic light using say purple for stop instead of red. Drivers would have to deduce what the color is used for.

Another example, google uses the google material design to build the designs of their different apps. Users who learn how to use one app will be able to use all the other apps.

The design for both gmail and google drive are very similar.

Many companies have their own guidelines for how applications should be designed.

For example: apple has [Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/) and Udacity has [Veritas](https://veritas.udacity.com/?path=/story/introduction--page)
