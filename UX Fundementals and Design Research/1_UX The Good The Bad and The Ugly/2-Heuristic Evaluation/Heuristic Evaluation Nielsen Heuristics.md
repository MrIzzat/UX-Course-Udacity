See usable security notes 11 for more information about heuristics.

A **heuristic** is a general rule or process that is used to help solve a problem quickly. Heuristics don't always generate the most optimal solution, but the solutions they do generate are very practical and instant.

A product's usability evaluated against the heuristics to determine if it's usable.

Usually, lots of research is needed before starting with the UX of a project. This requires lots of time and money. Heuristics are used as an alternative to research as they are quicker and come at no cost.

There are many different kinds of heuristics, a famous set are the 10 heuristics by Jakob Nielsen.

# Nielsen Heuristics

1. **Visibility of system status**: There should always be feed back to user actions. The user should be kept informed one way or another about what's going on in the system. 

For example, if the system is retrieving data that's going to take time to display, the user should be informed about the delay in a clear and concise way. It's even better if the user can be distracted to forget that they're waiting.

2. **Match between system and the real world**: The language used by the system should be something familiar to the user. Internal jargon or technical keywords should be avoided as not all users may intuitively understand them. It's better to use real world convetions. 

For example, if a user enters a website and they see a "cart", they'll understand quickly that the car represents a shopping cart. 

Another example, when snapchat uses the term "snap", it's unclear what they're refering to snapping a picture normally or if it's some special way of going about it.

3. **User control and freedom**: Users should be able to have some control over process.

For example, users should be able to cancel, undo or redo any actions they have done.

4. **Consistency and standards**: Products should follow standards and use consistent wording, concepts, interactions etc. throught the entire product. This is so users don't have to learn new methods for achieving the same goal.

For example, the standard for implementing a traffic light would be using the red for stop, yellow for caution and green for go. It would be inconsistent for a city to implement a traffic light using say purple for stop instead of red. Drivers would have to deduce what the color is used for.

Another example, google uses the google material design to build the designs of their different apps. Users who learn how to use one app will be able to use all the other apps. Google material design 3 can be viewed [here](https://m3.material.io/components/navigation-drawer/overview). *Note there is also google material design 2*

The design for both gmail and google drive are very similar.

Many companies have their own guidelines for how applications should be designed.

For example: apple has [Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/) and Udacity has [Veritas](https://veritas.udacity.com/?path=/story/introduction--page)

5. **Error Prevention**: The design should prevent users from making mistakes.

For example, the delete button should not be placed close to the save button so that the user doesn't accidently press delete whenever they try to save their work.

Another example, having a warning pop up asking the user if they are sure to delete something when they press the delete button.

6. **Recognition rather than recall**: It's easier to recognize information than trying to remember it.

For example, an auto complete feature is a lot easier for the user when inputting information rather than filling out the entire information. Gmail allows the autocompletetion of an email based upon their name. A user would enter the name of the person they want to send the email to and gmail auto fills that person's email.

7. **Flexibility and effeciency of use**: The product can be used by both new and expert users. It should be easy to learn but also provide shortcuts to users to have experience with it.

For example, github provides the desktop application for new users to manage their repositories. But also provides the git bash for expert users to be able to use more advanced features that help them manage their repositories quicker and easier.

Another example, Unity provides GUI buttons for certain tools for new users and keyboard shortcuts for the same tools for expert users.

8. **Aesthetics and minimalist design**: Users shouldn't be overwhelmed with unnecessary or irrelevent information. Elements on the screen are competing for a user's attention.

For example, google's search page is minimalist because there's nothing on the webpage except elements for searching. Users can focus on the task easily.

Another example, this taxi website design has way too many elements on the screen, which can be disctracting to the user, or might even overwhelm them.

9. **Help users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors**: Errors should be in plain language and actionable. An error message should be easy to understand and contain an action for the user to take to resolve the error.


For example, the following error is bad error message because it does not explain what went wrong nor does it help the user resolve the error.

Another example, this error on the other hand is a good error message because not only does it show the issue is a spelling mistake but it also suggests a couple of solutions to resolve the error.

10. **Help and documentation**: Users should be helped wherever it's needed, they shouldn't be forced to read a huge user manual to understand a certain feature.

For example, Miro provides text pop ups when hovering over certain buttons suggesting what they do, preventing the user from needing to search through their documentation to find what it does.
