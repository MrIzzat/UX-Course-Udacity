Users don't know about the product as much as the designer. 

Designers sometimes wrongfully assume the customer have similar knowledge to them. The phenomena is called the [**false-consensus effect**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_consensus_effect).

Users should be told what they need to know up front and straight forward.

Users should be considered to be too busy to do any research about the product.

A good point of reference about information the user should be aware of is the purpose of the product and the cost.


Users don't have the same domain knowledge the designer has.

Testing the designs on real users can overcome this issue. Will be discussed more on later.
