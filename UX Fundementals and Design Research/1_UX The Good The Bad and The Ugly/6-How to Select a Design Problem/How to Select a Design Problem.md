The first step in UX design is selecting the design problem.


An example of dissecting the main problem to see exactly what is required:

The final problem:

# Scope

When selecting a design problem, it's important to take into account:

* There is access to the participants needed to test the design
* The problem is in the scope of the project, it shouldn't be too large or to general.


# Textbook App Example

The example refers to a mobile app for college students to trade textbooks.

The scope isn't big.

Users of the design can be chosen based on a specific type of users, for example:

* Buyers: People who browse, search book by course or want to look at book details

* Sellers: people who list books to sell and set up a price

After the user(s) are found, a core task flow can be created. For example:

There can be many flows as follows:

* Sign-up flow: users can sign-up and log in
* Onborading experience
* Browsing books and looking at book details
* Scheduling a time and place to meet up for the trade
* Settings and privacy.

Selecting **Browsing books and looking at book details** can be selected as the core task flow, for example.

After selecting the user and core task flow, the design problem that had too broad of a scope turns from this:

```
Build an app for college students to trade textbooks.
```

To this:

```
WIthing a textbook trading app, build an experience that allows buyers to browse books and look at book details
```

Which is a lot more specific.
